jbot
=======

A lot of the code you see in this program is not my own. I took a lot of code from various sources such as MITB and JavaHacking. This is a learning experience. I am basically taking all the code released, learning how each line of code works and implementing it in order to make a RuneScape bot. I will probably eventually create my own bot with my own code from the knowledge and experience I gain from this project. This project is open source for only one reason; people besides me may be able to learn from it and not have to go through the tedious task of what I am doing (finding years old tutorials/code) in order to learn how the RuneScape client works or how to get started in RuneScape client hacking.
